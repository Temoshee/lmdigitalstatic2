# Bring-Your-Own interface for [Library of Michigan Digital](https://cdm16110.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/)

This is an experimental discovery layer for Library of Michigan Digital. It is a very narrowly focused niche website to search a small subset of documents without including all of the files in LMDigital. It comes from my experience as a reference librarian where I quickly need to access these documents without navigating a larger set of files. It is created from a [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) template.
