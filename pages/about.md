# This is a collection of selected legislative history documents mostly from 1973-1995.

The State Law Library frequently receives requests for scanned images of paper documents related to the legislative history of Michigan public acts. Rather then delete these files, we put them here for the next time.

## Daily requests for unique items

Many of these documents may not be available elsewhere. Before we set up a scanner the practice was to photocopy the pages and send them to the researcher. Consequently, some of the pages have been run through photocopiers so many times that the ink is disappearing. By scanning once and then posting the images here it helps with preservation.

## A living knowledge base

We hope to develop and maintain this useful information as part of the regular course of doing business rather than having a separate project.
